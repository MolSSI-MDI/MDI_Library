# Getting Started

There are two main ways you may use MDI: by running a pre-made MDI driver or by writing your own MDI driver.

The MDI API is sufficiently general to support a wide variety of techniques, including 

* Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM)
* ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
* Machine learning
* Advanced sampling
* Path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD)
* and many more!

This section provides introductory tutorials for using a pre-made MDI driver and for writing
your own MDI Driver.
