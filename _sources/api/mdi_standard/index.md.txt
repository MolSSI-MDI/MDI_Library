# MDI Standard

This section provides details on the commands defined by the MDI Standard.The MDI Standard defines a set of commands that can be used to control simulations and communicate data between engines.

You can also [tags](../../_tags/tagsindex) for the MDI Standard.

## Simulation Control and Node Management

Commands that control the flow of the simulation and manage the engine's nodes.

Command Name | Description
------------ | -----------
[@](commands/node-management/@) | Manage operations related to the current node.
[@COORDS](commands/node-management/@COORDS) | Go to point in code after atomic coordinates have been updated.
[@DEFAULT](commands/node-management/@DEFAULT) | Operations related to the @DEFAULT node. The @DEFAULT node is the node that the engine goes to when launched.
[@FORCES](commands/node-management/@FORCES) | Go to point in code after forces have been calculated.
[@INIT_MC](commands/node-management/@INIT_MC) | Initialize a Monte Carlo simulation.
[@INIT_MD](commands/node-management/@INIT_MD) | Initialize a Molecular Dynamics simulation.
[@INIT_OPTG](commands/node-management/@INIT_OPTG) | Initialize a geometry optimization.
[@PRE-FORCES](commands/node-management/@PRE-FORCES) | Go to point in code where forces have been partially calcualted.
[EXIT](commands/node-management/EXIT) | Exit the engine.
