Command Name | Description
------------ | -----------
[@](@) | Manage operations related to the current node.
[@COORDS](@COORDS) | Go to point in code after atomic coordinates have been updated.
[@DEFAULT](@DEFAULT) | Operations related to the @DEFAULT node. The @DEFAULT node is the node that the engine goes to when launched.
[@FORCES](@FORCES) | Go to point in code after forces have been calculated.
[@INIT_MC](@INIT_MC) | Initialize a Monte Carlo simulation.
[@INIT_MD](@INIT_MD) | Initialize a Molecular Dynamics simulation.
[@INIT_OPTG](@INIT_OPTG) | Initialize a geometry optimization.
[@PRE-FORCES](@PRE-FORCES) | Go to point in code where forces have been partially calcualted.
[EXIT](EXIT) | Exit the engine.
