# ENERGY
Receive total energy information.



## <ENERGY

Receive total energy.

**Datatype:** `MDI_DOUBLE`  
**Quantity**: `1`  

 If the engine is at the @DEFAULT node, it calculates and sends the total energy of its system to the driver.  If the engine has previously calculated the energy of the system, and no intervening commands from the driver could have changed the energy,  the engine is permitted to send the previously calculated energy instead of recalculating it.


### Examples


::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Python
:sync: python

```python
import mdi

# connect to the engine
mdi_engine = mdi.MDI_Accept_Communicator()

# receive the total energy from the engine
mdi.MDI_Send_Command("<ENERGY", mdi_engine)
energy = mdi.MDI_Recv(1, mdi.MDI_DOUBLE, mdi_engine)

```
:::

:::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cpp

```cpp
#include "mdi.h"

// connect to the engine
MDI_Comm mdi_engine = MDI_Accept_Communicator();

// create a buffer to hold the total energy
double energy;

// receive the total energy from the engine
MDI_Send_Command("<ENERGY", mdi_engine);
MDI_Recv(&energy, 1, MDI_DOUBLE, mdi_engine);

```
