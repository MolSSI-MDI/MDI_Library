(NDENSITY-target)=
# NDENSITY
Receive number of points for electronic density on a grid.



## <NDENSITY

Receive number of density grid points

**Datatype:** `MDI_INT`  
**Quantity**: `1`  

 The engine sends the number of grid points it is using to represent its electronic density on a grid. 
This command is intended to be used in conjuction with the [<CDENSITY](CDENSITY) and [<DENSITY](DENSITY) commands; 
these three commands enable a driver to acquire the electronic density distribution of an engine in a grid representation. 
See the [<DENSITY](DENSITY) command for more details.


### Examples


::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Python
:sync: python

```python
import mdi

# connect to the engine
mdi_engine = mdi.MDI_Accept_Communicator()

# receive the number of density grid points from the engine
mdi.MDI_Send_Command("<NDENSITY", mdi_engine)
ndensity = mdi.MDI_Recv(1, mdi.MDI_INT, mdi_engine)

```
:::

:::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cpp

```cpp
#include "mdi.h"

// connect to the engine
MDI_Comm mdi_engine = MDI_Accept_Communicator();

// create a buffer to hold the number of density grid points
int ndensity;

// receive the number of density grid points from the engine
MDI_Send_Command("<NDENSITY", mdi_engine);
MDI_Recv(&ndensity, 1, MDI_INT, mdi_engine);

```
