The Mol\+S\+SI Driver Interface (M\+DI) project provides a \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard}{standardized A\+PI}} for fast, on-\/the-\/fly communication between computational chemistry codes. This greatly simplifies the process of implementing methods that require the cooperation of multiple software packages and enables developers to write a single implementation that works across many different codes. The A\+PI is sufficiently general to support a wide variety of techniques, including Q\+M/\+MM, ab initio MD, machine learning, advanced sampling, and path integral MD, while also being straightforwardly extensible. Communication between codes is handled by the M\+DI Library, which enables tight coupling between codes using either the M\+PI or T\+C\+P/\+IP methods.

M\+DI uses a driver/engine paradigm in which \mbox{\hyperlink{index_main_doc_drivers_sec}{drivers}} orchestrate complex simulations by controlling \mbox{\hyperlink{index_main_doc_engines_sec}{engines}} through the use of an A\+P\+I-\/like command set that is defined by the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard}{M\+DI Standard}}. A driver will typically implement one or more high-\/level methods, such as advanced sampling or Q\+M/\+MM, while relying on one or more engines to perform lower-\/level operations, such as energy and force evaluation.

In total, M\+DI consists of the following components\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{index_main_doc_drivers_sec}{Drivers}}, which are codes that control the high-\/level program flow of one or more other codes.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{index_main_doc_engines_sec}{Engines}}, which are codes capable of responding to commands from an external driver.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard}{The M\+DI Standard}}, which is an A\+P\+I-\/like definition of a set of commands that can be sent from a driver to an engine, and that cause the engine to respond in a clearly defined way.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{library_page}{The M\+DI Library}}, which is a library that enables inter-\/code communication in compliance with the M\+DI Standard.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_mainpage_capabilities_sec}{}\doxysection{Capabilities}\label{index_mainpage_capabilities_sec}
M\+DI is designed to support a wide variety of different calculation types, with the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard}{M\+DI Standard}} defining a variety of simple commands that can be used to develop many drivers for many purposes. Potential application areas for M\+DI include {\itshape  ab initio} molecular dynamics (A\+I\+MD), path integral molecular dynamics (P\+I\+MD), advanced sampling, forcefield development, and Q\+M/\+MM. More specifically, here are some examples of what can be accomplished using M\+DI\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run an {\itshape  ab initio} molecular dynamics (A\+I\+MD) calculation in which a quantum mechanics (QM) code evaluates nuclear forces and a molecular mechanics (MM) code performs time integration.
\item Run an MD simulation in which the nuclear forces include contributions from two different MM codes.
\item Implement an advanced sampling technique ({\itshape i.\+e.} metadynamics, replica exchange, etc.) in a self-\/contained driver that can use other codes to compute forces.
\item Implement a new forcefield in a self-\/contained engine that is compatible with multiple MM codes.
\item Run Q\+M/\+MM simulations.
\end{DoxyItemize}

More generally, M\+DI can support any use case that can be implemented using the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_command_list}{command set}} defined by the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard}{M\+DI Standard}}. For use cases that require additional commands, unofficial extensions to the M\+DI Standard can be straightforwardly developed. Feel free to contact us if your use case requires additions to the M\+DI Standard, and we may be able to provide advice about the process. Extensions that prove useful to the broader community may be considered for official incorporation into the M\+DI Standard.\hypertarget{index_mainpage_getting_started_sec}{}\doxysection{Getting Started}\label{index_mainpage_getting_started_sec}

M\+DI builds upon the work of numerous development groups, without whom it could not exist. The syntactical structure of the M\+DI Standard, including the fundamental command-\/response communication pattern, is modelled after that used by the \href{http://ipi-code.org/}{\texttt{ i-\/\+PI}} project, as is the string-\/based representation of commands. The \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_standard_nodes_sec}{Node System}} draws inspiration from the techniques used by several molecular mechanics packages, especially \href{https://lammps.sandia.gov/}{\texttt{ L\+A\+M\+M\+PS}} and \href{http://openmm.org/}{\texttt{ Open\+MM}}, to enable modular code additions. The unit conversions available through the M\+DI Library were provided by the \href{https://github.com/MolSSI/QCElemental}{\texttt{ Q\+C\+Elemental}} project. Certain details of the communication protocols implemented by the M\+DI Library, especially pertaining to M\+P\+I-\/based communication in the M\+P\+MD regime, were informed by the accomplishments of the \href{https://cslib.sandia.gov/}{\texttt{ C\+Slib}} library. The library-\/based communication protocol was developed in response to discussions with the \href{https://gitlab.com/exaalt}{\texttt{ E\+X\+A\+A\+LT}} team. The interface, error handling, data types, and numerous other elements of the M\+DI Library are modelled after the \href{https://www.mpi-forum.org/}{\texttt{ M\+PI Standard}}. A distribution of the M\+DI Library for Python is provided by \href{https://conda-forge.org/}{\texttt{ Conda Forge}}.
