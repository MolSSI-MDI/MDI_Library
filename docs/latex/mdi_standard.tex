\hypertarget{mdi_standard_standard_overview}{}\doxysection{Overview}\label{mdi_standard_standard_overview}
The M\+DI Standard provides a straightforward, A\+P\+I-\/like method for enabling interoperability among computational molecular sciences codes. It uses a driver/engine model in which a driver code controls the high-\/level program flow of one or more engine codes. The driver exercises this control through the use of \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_command_list}{commands}} that are defined by the M\+DI Standard. Commands are available that correspond to a variety of tasks, such as \char`\"{}receive a new set of nuclear coordinates from me\char`\"{} (\mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_send_coords}{$>$C\+O\+O\+R\+DS}}), \char`\"{}start an M\+D simulation\char`\"{} (\mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_init_md}{@\+I\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+MD}}) and \char`\"{}send me the forces on the nuclei\char`\"{} (\mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_recv_forces}{$<$F\+O\+R\+C\+ES}}). The M\+DI standard defines the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_standard_units}{units}}, data types, and formatting of any data communicated between codes in response to a command.\hypertarget{mdi_standard_standard_extension}{}\doxysection{Extending the M\+D\+I Standard}\label{mdi_standard_standard_extension}
Although the M\+DI Standard has been designed to enable a wide range of potential applications, it is inevitable that some use cases will require functionality that is not yet supported by the standard. Typically, supporting such use cases will simply require addition of one or more new \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_command_list}{commands}} to the M\+DI Standard. Users who find themselves in need of a new M\+DI command are encouraged to create an \href{https://github.com/MolSSI-MDI/MDI_Library/issues}{\texttt{ issue}} describing their needs or submit a \href{https://github.com/MolSSI-MDI/MDI_Library/pulls}{\texttt{ pull request}} suggesting a solution.\hypertarget{mdi_standard_standard_units}{}\doxysection{Units}\label{mdi_standard_standard_units}
All physical quantities communicated through M\+DI must be expressed in atomic units. Whenever it is necessary to perform a unit conversion on data communicated through M\+DI, the conversion factor should be obtained through the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_8c_aa1ccf61d45e842b50d72084735cb984a}{M\+D\+I\+\_\+\+Conversion\+\_\+\+Factor()}} function. Use of this function ensures self-\/consistency in unit conversions between codes, which is important for avoiding numerical instabilities.\hypertarget{mdi_standard_standard_nodes_sec}{}\doxysection{Nodes}\label{mdi_standard_standard_nodes_sec}
One of the powerful features of the M\+DI Standard is that it permits drivers to take advantage of existing implementations of time integrators and geometry optimizers in M\+DI engines. In particular, the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_init_md}{@\+I\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+MD}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_init_optg}{@\+I\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+O\+P\+TG}} commands cause an engine to begin a molecular dynamics trajectory or a geometry optimization, respectively. Upon receiving one of these commands, an engine will perform the corresponding simulation without requiring further instruction from the driver, except that it will pause at certain \char`\"{}nodes\char`\"{} and listen for new commands.

The M\+DI Standard defines several nodes. Their names and when they occur are as follows\+:

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\bfseries{ @\+D\+E\+F\+A\+U\+LT }} -\/ Upon initially connecting to the driver. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+I\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+MC }} -\/ Upon initializing a new Monte Carlo simulation. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+I\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+MD }} -\/ Upon initializing a new molecular dynamics simulation. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+I\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+O\+P\+TG }} -\/ Upon initializing a new geometry optimization. ~\newline

\end{DoxyParagraph}
Not all M\+DI engines are required to support each of these nodes, with the exception of the @\+D\+E\+F\+A\+U\+LT node, which every M\+DI engine must support. Additional nodes may be defined by individual codes. Examples of possible code-\/specific nodes include\+:

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\bfseries{ @\+P\+RE-\/F\+O\+R\+C\+ES }} -\/ After calculating all contributions to the atomic forces, {\bfseries{except}} those associated with a constraint algorithm like S\+H\+A\+KE or R\+A\+T\+T\+LE. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+F\+O\+R\+C\+ES }} -\/ After calculating all contributions to the atomic forces. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+C\+O\+O\+R\+DS }} -\/ After updating the atomic coordinates.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Several M\+DI commands enable a driver to control the program flow of an engine through different nodes. The \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_send_node}{$<$@}} command instructs the engine to send the name of its node, while the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_next_node}{@}} command instructs the engine to proceed in its simulation until it reaches the next node. In addition, there are commands associated with each type of node (\mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_pre-forces_node}{@\+P\+RE-\/F\+O\+R\+C\+ES}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_forces_node}{@\+F\+O\+R\+C\+ES}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_coords_node}{@\+C\+O\+O\+R\+DS}}) which instruct the engine to proceed in its simulation until it reaches the next node of that particular type.

A specific MD implementation might progress from a @\+P\+RE-\/F\+O\+R\+C\+ES node, to the @\+F\+O\+R\+C\+ES node, to the @\+C\+O\+O\+R\+DS node, and then repeat the cycle; however, this behavior is {\bfseries{not}} guaranteed. Engines are permitted to pass through nodes in whatever order the implementation dictates. When writing drivers, it is a best practice to avoid assumptions about the ordering or frequency of nodes.

The M\+DI Library provides several functions that allow codes to define and communicate information about which nodes are supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_8c_ada45c73f15462764df0ac9e733b7d18e}{M\+D\+I\+\_\+\+Register\+\_\+\+Node()}}

This command is primarily intended for use with gas-\/phase quantum mechanics codes. For an alternative command that is more appropriate for plane wave quantum mechanics codes, see the {\ttfamily $>$P\+O\+T\+E\+N\+T\+I\+AL} command.

If the engine is at the {\ttfamily @\+D\+E\+F\+A\+U\+LT}  node, it calculates and sends its atomic forces to the driver.

The engine sends a label for each atom in its system. \char`\"{}\+Labels\char`\"{} are intended primarily for the purpose of providing a human-\/readable identifier for each of the atoms, and do not have a standardized physical meaning. It is recommended that the labels correspond to the element of each atom (i.\+e., \char`\"{}\+H\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+He\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+Li\char`\"{}, etc.), a name associated with atoms of a particular type (i.\+e., \char`\"{}\+Carboxyl\+\_\+\+Hydrogen\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+Methyl\+\_\+\+Hydrogen\char`\"{}), or a similarly descriptive term. The atom labels may correspond to a number identifier (i.\+e., \char`\"{}1\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}2\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}3\char`\"{}, etc.) in cases where more descriptive labels are not practical, but note that such labels must be represented using the {\ttfamily M\+D\+I\+\_\+\+C\+H\+AR} data type, as indicated below. It is required that atoms having different physical properties (i.\+e., different force field terms in a molecular mechanics simulation or different nuclear charges in a quantum chemistry simulation) have different labels.

This command, along with the {\ttfamily $>$N\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} and {\ttfamily $>$C\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} commands, allows the driver to assign a lattice of point charges to an engine, which incorporates the effects of these charges in all further calculations. After sending this command, the driver sends the charges of each of the point charges to the engine. Prior to sending this command, the driver must have set the number of point charges using the {\ttfamily $>$N\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} command.

This command is primarily intended for use with gas-\/phase quantum mechanics codes. For an alternative command that is more appropriate for plane wave quantum mechanics codes, see the {\ttfamily $>$P\+O\+T\+E\+N\+T\+I\+AL} command.

The engine sends the driver a string that corresponds to the argument of {\ttfamily -\/name} in the M\+DI initialization options. This argument allows a driver to identify the purpose of connected engine codes within the simulation. For example, a particular Q\+M/\+MM driver might require a connection with a single MM code and a single QM code, with the expected name of the MM code being \char`\"{}\+M\+M\char`\"{} and the expected name of the QM code being \char`\"{}\+Q\+M\char`\"{}. After initializing M\+DI and accepting communicators to the engines, the driver can use this command to identify which of the engines is the MM code and which is the QM code.
