\hypertarget{mdi_standard_standard_overview}{}\doxysection{Overview}\label{mdi_standard_standard_overview}
The M\+DI Standard provides a straightforward, A\+P\+I-\/like method for enabling interoperability among computational molecular sciences codes. It uses a driver/engine model in which a driver code controls the high-\/level program flow of one or more engine codes. The driver exercises this control through the use of \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_command_list}{commands}} that are defined by the M\+DI Standard. Commands are available that correspond to a variety of tasks, such as \char`\"{}receive a new set of nuclear coordinates from me\char`\"{} (\mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_send_coords}{$>$C\+O\+O\+R\+DS}}), \char`\"{}run a self-\/consistent field calculation\char`\"{} (scf\+\_\+command) and \char`\"{}send me the forces on the nuclei\char`\"{} (\mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_recv_forces}{$<$F\+O\+R\+C\+ES}}). The M\+DI standard defines the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_standard_units}{units}}, data types, and formatting of any data communicated between codes in response to a command.\hypertarget{mdi_standard_standard_units}{}\doxysection{Units}\label{mdi_standard_standard_units}
All physical quantities communicated through M\+DI must be expressed in atomic units. Whenever it is necessary to perform a unit conversion on data communicated through M\+DI, the conversion factor should be obtained through the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_8c_aa1ccf61d45e842b50d72084735cb984a}{M\+D\+I\+\_\+\+Conversion\+\_\+\+Factor()}} function. Use of this function ensures self-\/consistency in unit conversions between codes, which is important for avoiding numerical instabilities.\hypertarget{mdi_standard_standard_nodes_sec}{}\doxysection{Nodes}\label{mdi_standard_standard_nodes_sec}
One of the powerful features of the M\+DI Standard is that it permits drivers to take advantage of existing implementations of time integrators and geometry optimizers in M\+DI engines. In particular, the md\+\_\+init and optg\+\_\+init commands cause an engine to begin a molecular dynamics trajectory or a geometry optimization, respectively. Upon receiving one of these commands, an engine will perform the corresponding simulation without requiring further instruction from the driver, except that it will pause at certain \char`\"{}nodes\char`\"{} and listen for new commands.

The M\+DI Standard defines several nodes. Their names and when they occur are as follows\+:

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\bfseries{ @\+G\+L\+O\+B\+AL }} -\/ Upon initially connecting to the driver. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+I\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+MD }} -\/ Upon initializing a new molecular dynamics simulation. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+I\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+O\+P\+TG }} -\/ Upon initializing a new geometry optimization. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+P\+RE-\/F\+O\+R\+C\+ES }} -\/ After calculating all contributions to the atomic forces, {\bfseries{except}} those associated with a constraint algorithm like S\+H\+A\+KE or R\+A\+T\+T\+LE. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+F\+O\+R\+C\+ES }} -\/ After calculating all contributions to the atomic forces. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{ @\+C\+O\+O\+R\+DS }} -\/ After updating the atomic coordinates.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Several M\+DI commands are only relevant when an engine is paused at a node. The \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_send_node}{$<$@}} command instructs the engine to send the name of its node, while the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_next_node}{@}} command instructs the engine to proceed in its simulation until it reaches the next node. In addition, there are commands associated with each type of node (\mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_pre-forces_node}{@\+P\+RE-\/F\+O\+R\+C\+ES}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_forces_node}{@\+F\+O\+R\+C\+ES}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_coords_node}{@\+C\+O\+O\+R\+DS}}) which instruct the engine to proceed in its simulation until it reaches the next node of that particular type.

A typical MD implementation might progress from a @\+P\+RE-\/F\+O\+R\+C\+ES node, to the @\+F\+O\+R\+C\+ES node, to the @\+C\+O\+O\+R\+DS node, and then repeat the cycle; however, this behavior is {\bfseries{not}} guaranteed. Engines are permitted to pass through nodes in whatever order the implementation dictates. When writing drivers, it is a best practice to avoid assumptions about the ordering or frequency of nodes.\hypertarget{mdi_standard_standard_constants_sec}{}\doxysection{Constants}\label{mdi_standard_standard_constants_sec}
The following constants are defined by the M\+DI Standard and are accessible through the \mbox{\hyperlink{library_page}{M\+DI Library}}\+:

\hypertarget{mdi_standard_send_lattice}{}\doxysubsection{$>$\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE}\label{mdi_standard_send_lattice}
This command, along with the {\ttfamily $>$N\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} and {\ttfamily $>$C\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} commands, allows the driver to assign a lattice of point charges to an engine, which incorporates the effects of these charges in all further calculations. After sending this command, the driver sends the charges of each of the point charges to the engine. Prior to sending this command, the driver must have set the number of point charges using the {\ttfamily $>$N\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} command.

This command is primarily intended for use with gas-\/phase quantum mechanics codes. For an alternative command that is more appropriate for plane wave quantum mechanics codes, see the {\ttfamily $>$P\+O\+T\+E\+N\+T\+I\+AL} command.

\hypertarget{mdi_standard_send_name}{}\doxysubsection{$<$\+N\+A\+ME}\label{mdi_standard_send_name}
The engine sends the driver a string that corresponds to the argument of {\ttfamily -\/name} in the M\+DI initialization options. This argument allows a driver to identify the purpose of connected engine codes within the simulation. For example, a particular Q\+M/\+MM driver might require a connection with a single MM code and a single QM code, with the expected name of the MM code being \char`\"{}\+M\+M\char`\"{} and the expected name of the QM code being \char`\"{}\+Q\+M\char`\"{}. After initializing M\+DI and accepting communicators to the engines, the driver can use this command to identify which of the engines is the MM code and which is the QM code.

This command, along with the {\ttfamily $>$C\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} and {\ttfamily $>$L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} commands, allows the driver to assign a lattice of point charges to an engine, which incorporates the effects of these charges in all further calculations. After sending this command, the driver sends the number of point charges to the engine. This command must be sent before either the {\ttfamily $>$C\+L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} or {\ttfamily $>$L\+A\+T\+T\+I\+CE} commands can be sent.

This command is primarily intended for use with gas-\/phase quantum mechanics codes. For an alternative command that is more appropriate for plane wave quantum mechanics codes, see the {\ttfamily $>$P\+O\+T\+E\+N\+T\+I\+AL} command.

The driver sends an set of values to the engine that correspond to a potential on a grid. If an scf\+\_\+command command is later issued, this potential will be incorporated into the S\+CF calculation as an external potential.

Before sending this command, the driver must have first sent the number of grid points used to represent the potential via the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_send_npotential}{$>$N\+P\+O\+T\+E\+N\+T\+I\+AL}} command. It is also necessary that the driver send the Cartesian coordinates of the grid points via the \mbox{\hyperlink{mdi_standard_send_cpotential}{$>$C\+P\+O\+T\+E\+N\+T\+I\+AL}} command prior to any subsequent scf\+\_\+command command.

The driver sends a value for the total charge of the system, including electron and nuclear charges, to the engine, which adjusts the number of electrons present in its system to the value required to reproduce the value sent by the driver. This command is typically only appropriate for quantum mechanics engines. Engines that support this command are not required to support non-\/integer charges; they are permitted to produce an error message if the value received deviates by more than 10$^\wedge$-\/12 from an integer, and to otherwise round the value received to the nearest integer.
