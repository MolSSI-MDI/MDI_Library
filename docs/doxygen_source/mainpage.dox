\section mainpage_overview_sec Overview

The MolSSI Driver Interface (MDI) project provides a \ref mdi_standard "standardized API" for fast, on-the-fly communication between computational chemistry codes.
This greatly simplifies the process of implementing methods that require the cooperation of multiple software packages and enables developers to write a single implementation that works across many different codes.
The API is sufficiently general to support a wide variety of techniques, including QM/MM, ab initio MD, machine learning, advanced sampling, and path integral MD, while also being straightforwardly extensible.
Communication between codes is handled by the MDI Library, which enables tight coupling between codes using either the MPI or TCP/IP methods.

MDI uses a driver/engine paradigm in which \ref main_doc_drivers_sec "drivers" orchestrate complex simulations by controlling \ref main_doc_engines_sec "engines" through the use of an API-like command set that is defined by the \ref mdi_standard "MDI Standard".
A driver will typically implement one or more high-level methods, such as advanced sampling or QM/MM, while relying on one or more engines to perform lower-level operations, such as energy and force evaluation.

In total, MDI consists of the following components:

  - \ref main_doc_drivers_sec "Drivers", which are codes that control the high-level program flow of one or more other codes.

  - \ref main_doc_engines_sec "Engines", which are codes capable of responding to commands from an external driver.

  - \ref mdi_standard "The MDI Standard", which is an API-like definition of a set of commands that can be sent from a driver to an engine, and that cause the engine to respond in a clearly defined way.

  - \ref library_page "The MDI Library", which is a library that enables inter-code communication in compliance with the MDI Standard.



\section mainpage_capabilities_sec Capabilities

MDI is designed to support a wide variety of different calculation types, with the \ref mdi_standard "MDI Standard" defining a variety of simple commands that can be used to develop many drivers for many purposes.
Potential application areas for MDI include <em> ab initio</em> molecular dynamics (AIMD), path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD), advanced sampling, forcefield development, and QM/MM.
More specifically, here are some examples of what can be accomplished using MDI:

  - Run an <em> ab initio</em> molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculation in which a quantum mechanics (QM) code evaluates nuclear forces and a molecular mechanics (MM) code performs time integration.
  - Run an MD simulation in which the nuclear forces include contributions from two different MM codes.
  - Implement an advanced sampling technique (<em>i.e.</em> metadynamics, replica exchange, etc.) in a self-contained driver that can use other codes to compute forces.
  - Implement a new forcefield in a self-contained engine that is compatible with multiple MM codes.
  - Run QM/MM simulations.

More generally, MDI can support any use case that can be implemented using the \ref command_list "command set" defined by the \ref mdi_standard "MDI Standard".
For use cases that require additional commands, unofficial extensions to the MDI Standard can be straightforwardly developed.
Feel free to contact us if your use case requires additions to the MDI Standard, and we may be able to provide advice about the process.
Extensions that prove useful to the broader community may be considered for official incorporation into the MDI Standard.



\section mainpage_getting_started_sec Getting Started

For guidance on running simulations using MDI-based drivers and engines, please first complete the \ref user_tutorial.
Afterwards, please read \ref library_launching_sec.

If you intend to develop an MDI-based driver or engine, first do the above.
Then, complete the \ref aimd_tutorial and familiarize yourself with the \ref functions_sec.

For lists of available MDI-based drivers and engines, see \ref main_doc_drivers_sec and \ref main_doc_engines_sec.

MDI builds upon the work of numerous development groups, without whom it could not exist.
The syntactical structure of the MDI Standard, including the fundamental command-response communication pattern, is modelled after that used by the <a href="http://ipi-code.org/">i-PI</a> project, as is the string-based representation of commands.
The \ref standard_nodes_sec "Node System" draws inspiration from the techniques used by several molecular mechanics packages, especially <a href="https://lammps.sandia.gov/">LAMMPS</a> and <a href="http://openmm.org/">OpenMM</a>, to enable modular code additions.

The library-based communication protocol was developed in response to discussions with the <a href="https://gitlab.com/exaalt">EXAALT</a> team.
