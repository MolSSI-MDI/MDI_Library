# MDI Ecosystem
MDI is supported by a variety of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics codes. MDI is directly supported by the following codes:

* LAMMPS
* OpenMM
* Psi4
* QCEngine
* Quantum ESPRESSO
* Tinker

Note that QCEngine allows you to run a variety of quantum chemistry codes through a single interface and supports the following codes for use with MDI:

* DFT-D3
* entos
* PetaChem
* Molpro
* MOPAC
* RDKit
* TorchAni

The following codes support i-PI, with which MDI is compatible (see the -ipi option). Note that the i-PI command set is different from that of the MDI Standard.

* CP2K
* DFTB+
* Siesta
* FHI-aims
* Yaff
* deMonNano
* TBE
